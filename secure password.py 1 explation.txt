Explanation:
secrets.choice(alphabet): Uses secrets.choice() to select a random character from the alphabet.
string.ascii_letters: Contains all lowercase and uppercase letters.
string.digits: Contains all digits.
string.punctuation: Contains all punctuation characters.
How it works:
Alphabet Generation: The alphabet variable combines lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation. This ensures a diverse set of characters in the generated password.

Password Generation Loop: The while True loop generates passwords until a strong password is created. A strong password here is defined as:

Contains at least one lowercase letter (any(c.islower() for c in password)).
Contains at least one uppercase letter (any(c.isupper() for c in password)).
Contains at least three digits (sum(c.isdigit() for c in password) >= 3).
Contains at least one punctuation character (any(c in string.punctuation for c in password)).
If the generated password meets these criteria, the loop breaks and the password is returned.

Main Block: If the script is run directly (, not imported as a module), it generates a password using generate_password() and prints it.
